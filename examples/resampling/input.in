# This is a VMaChine configuration file where
# a two-dimensional quantum dot consisting of
# two electrons is simulated. The trial wave 
# function used is a Gaussian with a Pad√©-Jastrow
# factor. The Slater determinant is
# only needed when increasing the number of
# particles. Resampling is done using the
# Blocking method, which requires numSteps=2^N
# where N is an integer (here N=17).
