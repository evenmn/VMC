# This is a VMaChine configuration file where
# a two-dimensional quantum dot consisting of
# two electrons is simulated. The trial wave 
# function used is a Gaussian with a Pad√©-Jastrow
# factor. The Slater determinant is
# only needed when increasing the number of
# particles. The radial one-body density is 
# computed and written to the file "onebody.dat".
# The number of Metropolis steps, numSteps, has
# to be set such that numSteps=2^N where N is an
# integer in order to resample efficiently. 
# Here N=17.
