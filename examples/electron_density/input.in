# This is a VMaChine configuration file where
# a two-dimensional quantum dot consisting of
# two electrons is simulated. The trial wave 
# function used is a Gaussian with a Pad√©-Jastrow
# factor. The Slater determinant is
# only needed when increasing the number of
# particles. The spatial one-body density is 
# computed and written to the file "onebody2.dat".
