# This is a VMaChine configuration file where
# a helium atom is simulated. The trial wave 
# function used is a Slater determinant with
# a hydrogen-like orbital basis.
# The number of Metropolis steps, numSteps, has
# to be set such that numSteps=2^N where N is an
# integer in order to resample efficiently.
# Here N=17.
